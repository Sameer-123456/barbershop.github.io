<h2>Barbershop</h2>
<p>A barber is a person whose occupation is mainly to cut, dress, groom, style and shave men's and boys' hair or beards. A barber's place of work is known as a "barbershop" or a "barber's".  The barber's trade has a long history: razors have been found among relics of the Bronze Age (around 3500 BC) in Egypt. <p>The first barbering services were performed by Egyptians in 5000 B.C. with instruments they had made from oyster shells or sharpened flint.[2] In ancient Egyptian culture, barbers were highly respected individuals.</p> <p>Priests and men of medicine are the earliest recorded examples of barbers.[3] In addition, the art of barbering played a significant role across continents.</p> <span id="dots">...</span><span id="moreText">
<p>Mayan, Aztec, Iroquois, Viking and Mongolian civilizations utilized shave art as a way to distinguish roles in society and wartime.[4] Men in Ancient Greece would have their beards, hair, and fingernails trimmed and styled by the κουρεύς (cureus), in an agora (market place) which also served as a social gathering for debates and gossip.</p>
  <p>Barbershops are also places of social interaction and public discourse. In some instances, barbershops are also public fora. They are the locations of open debates, voicing public concerns, and engaging citizens in discussions about contemporary issues.
